#Introduction

While working with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, there are many small tools or libraries you can use to make your work easier or more productive.

For example you may choose to write your CSS code using SCSS and Compass, You will need to compile your SCSS or Compass files to CSS format. Or you might use multiple javascript plugins to add interactivity to your webpage. There are times when you want to merge all your javascript files into a single file, to improve page speed, or to compress the artwork to make the images smaller in terms of file size. These are only few examples of tasks that you can automate with help of gulp.js
